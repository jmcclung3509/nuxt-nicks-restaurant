				Indulge in the splendor of ocean waves pounding against the
				shore, the elegance of sea birds soaring over foamy water, and
				the allure of sunbeams glimmering on the back of a gray whale.
				Unwind and bask in the serene atmosphere of Rockaway Beach's
				picturesque cove. It's no surprise that this enchanting location
				lured a man from thousands of miles away to call it his home.

				Stalios Karagianis, born in Macedonia, Greece in 1886, boarded a
				ship named the Konstantinos at the age of twenty and embarked on
				a journey to America. After arriving in New York, he traveled
				across the country and settled in San Francisco, where he found
				various jobs, including working in a vegetable store, as a
				jitney driver, and on the Ocean Shore Railroad. His work on the
				railroad eventually led him to the breathtaking Pacifica
				coastside.

				As many immigrants coming to America did at the time, Karagianis
				americanized his name, changing it to Charles Gust. After a few
				years of working and saving, he sent for his wife, Anastasia, to
				join him. Togethe, they built a house in Daly City and raised
				four children. In 1927, Karagianis purchased a property on the
				water's edge at Rockaway Beach, where he established a business
				selling sandwiches, peanuts, and candy to fishermen and
				beachgoers. Tragedy struck when his business burnt down, but he
				rebuilt it and continued serving visitors. Despite another fire,
				he persisted and made Rockaway Beach his family's home.
